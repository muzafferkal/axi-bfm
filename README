AXI3 initiator and target Bus Functional Models.
These were done to replace Xilinx AXI VIP which required a license but they no longer do.
So if you're doing XILINX FPGA work, it might be a good idea to use them.
At this point I don't mean to maintain these any longer but let me know if you have a need.
